# Keyboard Helper
This program will help bypass anti-paste protection (when applications do not allow copying from the clipboard).

## Anti-Anti-Pasta. How it works?
The program emulates pressing buttons on the keyboard and allows you to quickly type text into fields where pasting is prohibited.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Installation
- Clone this repository using `https://github.com/Top4ak/Keyboard-Helper.git`

## How to use?
- Copy your text into the input box
- Set delay in settings
- Run the simulation by clicking the 'run' button or using hotkeys
- After you have time (delay) to focus the input on the window where you want to copy the text
- After the delay, do not touch the keyboard until the program has entered all the text
